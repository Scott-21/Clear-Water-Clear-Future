    <h2>Our Advocacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to support Sustainable Development Goal 6: 
        ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all. 
        We believe that water is not just a necessity—it is a right.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
        According to the World Health Organization, 2.2 billion people 
        worldwide do not have safe drinking water. In the Philippines, 
        1 in 10 families still struggles to access clean water, and 1 in 5 
        lacks basic sanitation facilities. This crisis leads to diseases such as 
        diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid, which affect millions of children.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
        Our website provides information, resources, and ways to help. 
        From spreading awareness to supporting water projects, we 
        encourage everyone to take part in making a change.
